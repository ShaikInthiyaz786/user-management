## 🔗 API Integration

This project interacts with the JSONPlaceholder API for demonstration purposes. The following API endpoints are used:

Get Users: GET /users
Add User: POST /users
Edit User: PUT /users/{id}
Delete User: DELETE /users/{id}

## 📦 Packages Used

React: For building the user interface.
react-router-dom: For routing between pages.
axios: For making API requests.
Bootstrap (optional): For responsive and styled UI components.

## 💻 How to Use

Fetch Users
Open the application.
View the list of users fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API.
Add a User
Click on the "Add User" button.
Fill out the form with user details.
Submit to add the user to the list.
Edit a User
Click on the "Edit" button next to a user.
Update the details in the form.
Submit to save the changes.
Delete a User
Click on the "Delete" button next to a user.
Confirm the action to remove the user from the list.

## 🛠️ Known Issues

Data persistence: The JSONPlaceholder API does not save changes, so added/edited/deleted users are not persistent.
Pagination and infinite scrolling require manual adjustments to simulate API responses.
